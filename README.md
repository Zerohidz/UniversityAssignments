# University Assignments Repository

Welcome to the repository for my university assignments! Here, you'll find a collection of projects completed during various terms of my academic journey. The repository is organized into three main directories:

1. **Term2**: This directory holds projects completed during the second term of my studies. All projects in this directory are written in Java.

2. **Term3**: Inside this directory, you'll find assignments from the third term. These projects are implemented using C++.

3. **Term4**: Here, you'll discover projects from the fourth term, all of which are written in Java.

Feel free to explore the directories and delve into the projects.
